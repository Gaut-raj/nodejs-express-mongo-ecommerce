## üöÄ Features  

- **Express.js** for dynamic routing  
- **MongoDB** integration for data storage  
- Clean and modern UI with **CSS**  
- Local development with **Nodemon**

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
 git clone https://github.com/Gaut-raj/nodejs-express-mongo-ecommerce.git 
 cd nodejs-express-mongo-ecommerce
run localhost:3000 with nodemon app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Project Status  

This project is currently **read-only** due to the inclusion of a public MongoDB cluster connection. To prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the database, we have restricted any write or administrative operations.  

### Why Read-Only?  
1. **Security Concerns**: The public MongoDB URI in use allows anyone to connect. For safety, only read operations are permitted.
2. **Educational Use**: This setup is designed for demonstration purposes to showcase the code and query logic.
3. **Prevention of Abuse**: Limiting write access protects the cluster from malicious or accidental changes.

### How to Use the Project
- Clone the repository and review the code.
- You can connect to the database and perform **read operations** to explore the functionality.
- Write operations (such as creating, updating, or deleting data) are currently disabled.

### Future Improvements
In future updates, the project will implement:
- **Environment Variables**: Using `.env` files to securely store and load MongoDB URIs.
- **Authentication**: Allowing authorized users to perform write operations securely.
- **Local Setup**: Providing instructions to set up MongoDB locally for unrestricted testing.
